            <div class="content">
                <p>An introduction to electrical and computer engineering. Topics include 
                circuit theory, assembly, and testing, embedded systems programming and 
                debugging, transducer mechanisms and interfacing transducers, signals and 
                systems theory, digital signal processing, and modular design techniques. </p>

            <button class="collapsible">ECE 16: Rapid Hardware and Software Design for Interfacing with the World</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Students are introduced to embedded systems concepts with structured 
                development of a computer controller based on electromyogram (EMG) signals 
                through four lab assignments through the quarter. Key concepts include: 
                sampling, signal processing, communication, and real-time control. Students 
                will apply their prior knowledge in C to program microcontrollers and will 
                engage in data analysis using the Python programming language.</p>
            </div>        
            <button class="collapsible">ECE 111: Advanced Digital Design Project</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Advanced topics in digital circuits and systems. Use of computers and 
                design automation tools. Hazard elimination, synchronous/asynchronous 
                FSM synthesis, synchronization and arbitration, pipelining and timing 
                issues. Problem sets and design exercises. A large-scale design project.

                <p>Building on a solid foundation of electrical and computer engineer skills, 
                this course strives to broaden student skills in software, full-stack engineering, 
                and concrete understanding of methods related to the realistic development of 
                a commercial product. Students will research, design, and develop an IOT 
                device to serve an emerging market. </p>

            <button class="collapsible">ECE 144: LabVIEW Programming: Design and Applications</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Develop, debug, and test LabVIEW VIs, solve problems using LabVIEW, use 
                data acquisition, and perform signal processing and instrument control in 
                LabVIEW applications. Groups of students will build an elevator system 
                from laser-cut and 3-D printed parts; integrate sensors, motors, and 
                servos; and program using state-machine architecture in LabVIEW. Students 
                will have the opportunity to take the National Instruments Certified LabVIEW 
                Associate Developer (CLAD) exam at the end of the quarter.</p>
